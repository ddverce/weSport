# Wesport

A web-app coded to let people organise with other people, book fields to club regitered in our platform and have fun playing the sport they like!

Club managers can do the same as they can register their own club on WeSports and add some essential information such as the name of the club, the address, the phone number and the fields they have at disposal (e.g. the sport itâ€™s possible to play there).
