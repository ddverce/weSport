            <h1><b>Who we are</b></h1>
            <h4>We are Abdullah Ashfaq, Anas Khalike, Alberto Molinar Roet, Tommaso Sacchi, Matteo Babini and Davide Vercellone:
                6 students from the Polytechnic University of Turin who are passionate about Information Systems and, most of all (sorry professor!) Sports.
                We came up with the idea of creating a platform that could allow students to get to know other people while playing the sports they love. It may not be easy
                to get a new place and get to know other people, especially someone to play sports with. Do not panic, we sorted it out: there is WeSports!

            <h4>Wesports is a platform that allows a user to create an event and invite her/his friends to join it. When booking, it is possible
            to see on the map the clubs close to you, choose between them according to the sport you want to play, choose the field, the date and time.
            Then you choose who to invite between your friends and off you go! Don't forget the stuff you need to play!</h4>
            <h2><b>If you want players to come to your club</b></h2>
            <h4>WeSports can be used not just by players, but by clubs as well! As a matter of fact, it can be used as a club manager, showing the user's clubs and fields per club available
            for different sports and the position of the club on the map, so that players can find clubs in their city and around them. Through WeSports, a club can increase its visibility and
            be automatically managed through WeSports. No more messy calendars, names and phone numbers to remember, just one smart web page to have complete control of your club!</h4>
